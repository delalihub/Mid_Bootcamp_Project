# Investigating  gender pay-gap of US Whitehouse staff using hypothesis testing.

This project took a deep dive into the salaries of Whitehouse staff from 1997-2020 based on gender. The project gave an insight to staff salaries from the Clinton administration to the Trump administration. A hypothesis was formed and tested which mirrored the situation with staff salaries in the US Whitehouse.
